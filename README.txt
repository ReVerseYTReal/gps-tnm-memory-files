hey!
thanks for downloading my stuff
this is just a crappy project i made with python
you MUSTTTTTTTTTTT have python 3.13.2 installed for the opener to work
instructions:

1. MANDATORY: install python 3.13.2 (i wrote the script in python, and used pyinstaller to package it)
2. download the .mem files (or the ones you want)
3. MANDATORY: download the opener (should be memopener.exe)
4. set .mem files to open with the opener
4.1. right click on any .mem file
4.2. select "open with" and click "more" and scroll down
4.3. click "open with another file"
4.4. find where you installed the opener (usually your "Downloads" folder) and click that
5. open the .mem file and it will launch tnm 6!
